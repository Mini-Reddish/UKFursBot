## Getting started

Install docker if not installed already.

create the .env file in the solution folder.
You will need the following parameters
``` 
DB_PASSWORD : <YOUR CHOSEN DB PASSWORD>

These variables are set up to be used within the docker.compose file.
Running that should set up the bot and database for you and it should all work okay.
